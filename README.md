Friend Finder Application

Description

User responds to questions with values from 1 to 5. When the survey is submitted, an existing user record closest to the current user's responses is found and shown to the user. The closest set of user responses is defined as the set with the lowest absolute difference for all ten questions combined (to also prevent negative numbers from affecting the outcome for any reason).

Friend Finder application is meant to simulate a simple dating app. The application is implemented using a Node.js and Express server on the back end and the Materialize CSS framework on the front end.
